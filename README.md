# Binary-Classification-with-a-Bank-Dataset
Predict whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit.

Overview
This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their historical and demographic information. The dataset represents typical features found in banking and marketing analytics, enabling machine learning practitioners to apply and test their skills on business-relevant problems.

**Project Structure**
- data/ – Includes raw and processed datasets.
- notebooks/ – Contains exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation notebooks.
- src/ – Python scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling.
- outputs/ – Model predictions, submission files, and visualizations.
- README.md – Project summary, methodology, and instructions.

**Dataset Description**
- Features available in the dataset include:
- Demographic information: age, job, marital status, education
- Economic indicators: balance, housing/loan status
- Campaign data: number of contacts, previous outcomes, communication type
- Target variable: Subscription outcome (binary: yes/no)

**Approach**
1. Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions
- Applied feature encoding for categorical variables
- Engineered new features to improve predictive power

2. Model Development
- Compared multiple classification algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search

3. Evaluation
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Visualized model performance with confusion matrices and ROC curves

4. Submission
- Prepared test predictions for Kaggle submission
- Documented insights and best-performing approaches

**Key Results**
- Achieved high classification accuracy and robust performance across a variety of models
- Identified the most influential features contributing to term deposit subscription
- Published well-documented code and analysis for reproducibility

**How to Run**
